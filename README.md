## Introduction
Hi! I am a fourth-year physics undergraduate student with a data science minor at IISER Thiruvananthapuram. 
This github repository contains progress in the projects I have participated in. 
This repository will be updated with time.

## Projects
### IUCAA Pune / Project H<sub>0</sub> / 2021
With Prof. Sanjit Mitra and Kanchan Soni
* The aim of this project was to understand the inclusion of higher modes to improve parameter estimates.
* Injection studies were conducted recreating the BBH signal GW150914 over a Gaussian noise. 
* IMRPhenomPv2, SpinTaylorT5threePointFivePN were some of the waveform models employed. 

### AEI Hannover / Tests of GR / 2022
With Dr Frank Ohme and Dr Krishnendu V Nair
* The aim of this project was prediction of the results of the next-generation gravitational-wave detectors (ET and CE)
* We evaluated SNRs for some simulated GW events and analysed the SNR dependance on masses and distances of mergers.

### PHY5132 Project / Estimating the Hubble parameter / 2022
With Shubham Chury
* The aim of this project was to constrain the values of the Hubble parameter.
* We analysed the event GW170817 and found posteriors on luminosity distance, psi and phase.
* We also compared the the waveform models IMRPhenomPv2, SpinTaylorT4 and IMRPhenomPv2_NRTidal.

### IISER Thiruvananthapuram, IUCAA Pune / Minor Project / 2023 (tentative)
With Dr Shabnam Iyyani and Dr Apratim Ganguly
* The aim of this project is to conduct predictive analysis in the deci-hertz region of gravitational-wave astronomy.
