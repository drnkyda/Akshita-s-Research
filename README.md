## Introduction
Hi! I am a fourth-year physics undergraduate student with a data science minor at IISER Thiruvananthapuram. 
This github repository contains progress in the projects I have participated in. 
This repository will be updated with time.

## Projects
### IUCAA Pune / Project H<sub>0</sub> / 2021
With Prof. Sanjit Mitra and Kanchan Soni
* To understand the inclusion of higher modes to improve parameter estimates
* Injection studies conducted recreating the BBH signal GW150914 over a Gaussian noise 
* IMRPhenomPv2, SpinTaylorT5threePointFivePN waveform models employed

### AEI Hannover / Tests of GR / 2022
With Dr Frank Ohme and Dr Krishnendu V Nair
* Prediction of the results of the next-generation gravitational-wave detectors (ET and CE)
* Evaluated SNRs for some simulated GW events and 
* Analysed SNR dependance on masses and distances of mergers

### PHY5132 Project / Estimating the Hubble parameter / 2022
With Shubham Chury
* To constrain the values of the Hubble parameter
* Analysed the event GW170817 and found posteriors on luminosity distance, psi and phase
* Calculated Bayes factor and compared the the waveform models IMRPhenomPv2, SpinTaylorT4 and IMRPhenomPv2_NRTidal

### IISER Thiruvananthapuram, IUCAA Pune / Minor Project / 2023 (tentative)
With Dr Shabnam Iyyani and Dr Apratim Ganguly
* To conduct predictive analysis in the deci-hertz region of gravitational-wave astronomy for DECIGO
